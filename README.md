# HabitList

A habit tracker inspired by the awesome [Habit List](https://habitlist.com/), built in Angular 6, for learning purposes, to take the thinking away from the product and keep the focus on implementation. Currently just a front-end that kicks off with hardcoded-data. See `package.json` for Angular version and other dependencies.

### Setup

* Install the JS dependencies `yarn install`

### Usage

Run `ng serve --open` for a dev server which automatically launches browser, at: `http://localhost:4200`.
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
